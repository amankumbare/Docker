>> Pull Spacebones Image
Student should pull the docker image located here. This can be done via the command:

# docker pull spacebones/doge
Since it is stored at Docker Hub, this will find the image required.

>>  Start the Website Container and Redirect HTTP Port 80 to the Host

The student will be starting a container from the spacebones/doge image installed locally in the previous step, named 'treatseekers', in disconnected mode, redirecting container port 80 to host port 80. The command to accomplish this is:

# docker run -d  --name treatseekers -p 80:80 spacebones/doge
ebcf31ed2f13b454431b28641a1e87245c8fa18ffa5b564cdeae5ef0ead24954

-d detach from the container and print container name
-p Publish a container's port(s) to the host (default [])
-name name of the container

You can verify it is running after with

# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
ebcf31ed2f13        spacebones/doge     "nginx -g 'daemon ..."   21 seconds ago      Up 20 seconds       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   treatseekers

Which will tell you the container, name and port that is currently running

Container Called 'Treatseekers' is Running

>> exposed port of a running container.
# docker port treatseekers
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:80



>> Pull the CentOS 6 Image from DockerHub
The student is being asked to pull the latest CentOS 6 image from the DockerHub. This can be accomplished via:

# docker pull centos:6
You can verify with

# docker images
Which will show the local image installations, of which, CentOS:6 will now be one


Create a Local Image from the Downloaded CentOS 6 Base
student should create a new image using the Centos 6 image named spacebones:thewebsite

# docker run -it centos:6 /bin/bash

Inside the container:
# yum install git httpd -y
# git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-dockerquest-spacebones/
# cp /content-dockerquest-spacebones/doge/* /var/www/html/
# mv /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.html /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.bak
# chkconfig httpd on
exit


# docker commit <Container NAME/ID>  <Name>:<Tag>
# docker commit f62b5cb6fe8b spacebone:thewebsit
